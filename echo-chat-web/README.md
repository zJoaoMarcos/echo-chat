# EchoChat

The EchoChat is an application that allows users to connect their Discord servers to real-time chat rooms within the application. This integration enables users to interact with members of their community both on Discord and in the real-time chat application, providing a unified communication experience.

The design of this project is inspired by this dribbble [project](https://dribbble.com/shots/20580191-Clerk-chat-component) 

## Features:

- [] Discord Server Integration:
Discord server administrators can connect their servers to the ChatBridge application through a simple setup. This will establish a communication bridge between Discord text channels and the application's chat rooms.

- [] Message Synchronization:
All messages sent in the connected Discord text channels will be synchronized in real-time with corresponding chat rooms in the application, and vice versa. This allows community members to converse and collaborate regardless of whether they are on Discord or in the application.

- [] Real-Time Notifications:
Users will receive real-time notifications about new messages in the application's chat channels and connected Discord channels. This ensures that they stay updated and engaged in all important conversations.

- [] Permission Control:
Administrators can configure permissions to control who can access and participate in the application's chat rooms and connected Discord channels. This ensures security and privacy for community members.

- [] Identity Integration:
Users can choose to link their user accounts in the application with their Discord accounts. This allows for a smooth transition between the two environments and facilitates the identification of community members.
Benefits:

- [] Communication Unification:
The ChatBridge offers an integrated solution for communication among community members, regardless of whether they are on Discord or in the real-time chat application.

- [] Increased Engagement:
By synchronizing messages and real-time notifications, the ChatBridge keeps users engaged and connected in all important conversations.

- [] Flexibility and Control:
With permission controls and identity integration, administrators have full control over who can access and participate in conversations in their communities.
This project idea offers a unique way to add value to users by providing a unified communication experience and facilitating interaction across different platforms.
